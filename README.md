# Tetripy
Tetripy is basically Tetris made in Python Tkinter canvas by me. Enjoy and ignore the bugs.

## How to install
Download the entire repository.  
Double-click `play.py` to play! (I do not recommend playing it in IDLE, because restarting is a bit weird)

## More info
You can modify `config.txt` to change the mode.  
`mode:light` is light mode and `mode:dark` is dark mode.  
You can also change this in the game.
